  - title: Creating Plots
    desc: >
      Everything starts here. The `plot2()` function is the heart of this
      package -- just pass in your data and it will figure out the best
      way to visualise it. Whether you have a data frame, a matrix, a
      statistical model, or even geographic data, `plot2()` knows what to
      do. Want to layer extra elements on top? Use `add_type()` and its
      convenient shortcuts to build up your plot step by step.
    contents:
      - plot2
      - plot2-methods
      - add_type

  - title: Customising Your Plot
    desc: >
      Already have a plot but want to fine-tune it? These functions let
      you change which variables are mapped to visual properties like
      colour or size, reorder the layers that make up your plot, or
      switch to a spider (radar) chart layout. Small adjustments can make
      a big difference in how clearly your data tells its story.
    contents:
      - add_mapping
      - move_layer
      - coord_spider

  - title: Working with Colours
    desc: >
      Colour is one of the most powerful tools in data visualisation.
      These functions give you access to a wide range of colour palettes
      -- including colourblind-friendly options -- and let you define and
      save your own custom colours for consistent use across all your
      plots and projects.
    contents:
      - colour

  - title: Themes and Labels
    desc: >
      Great plots deserve a clean, professional look. `theme_minimal2()`
      gives your plots a modern, print-ready appearance with sensible
      defaults. The other functions in this section help you use
      **bold**, *italic*, and other rich formatting in your plot titles
      and axis labels, and make it easy to extract or customise the
      title of any plot.
    contents:
      - theme_minimal2
      - md_to_expression
      - get_plot_title
      - labellers

  - title: Number Formatting
    desc: >
      Numbers on axes and in labels should be easy to read, regardless
      of where in the world your audience is. These helpers automatically
      format numbers with the right decimal separator and thousands
      grouping for your locale, and can display values as euros or
      dollars.
    contents:
      - dec_mark

  - title: Interactive Plots
    desc: >
      Want your audience to hover, zoom, and click on your plots? Turn
      any plot into an interactive widget with `as_plotly()`, or use
      `create_interactively()` to build a plot from scratch using a
      point-and-click interface -- no code required.
    contents:
      - plotly
      - create_interactively

  - title: Default Settings
    desc: >
      Tired of setting the same options every time? Configure your
      preferred defaults -- such as your go-to colour scheme, font, or
      decimal format -- once, and every plot you create will
      automatically use them.
    contents:
      - plot2-options

  - title: Example Datasets
    desc: >
      These built-in datasets are ready to use for exploring `plot2()`
      and trying out different plot types. No need to load external
      files -- just type the dataset name and start plotting.

  - title: Convenience Functions
    desc: >
      A handful of commonly used helper functions from other packages,
      made available directly through `plot2` so you do not need to load
      additional packages for everyday tasks like counting rows or
      selecting columns.
