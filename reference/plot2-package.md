# plot2: A Plotting Assistant for Fast 'ggplot2' Visualisations

A streamlined extension of 'ggplot2' designed to simplify and accelerate
the creation of data visualisations. 'plot2' automates common tasks such
as axis handling, plot type selection, and data transformation, allowing
users to create complex, publication-ready plots with minimal code. It
integrates seamlessly with the tidyverse and retains full compatibility
with 'ggplot2', while offering additional conveniences like enhanced
sorting, faceting, and custom theming.
